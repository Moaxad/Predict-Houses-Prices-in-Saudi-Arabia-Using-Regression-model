# Predict-Houses-Prices-in-Saudi-Arabia-Using-Regression-model
The main goal of this project is to build a regression model to predict houses prices (rent per year) in Saudi Arabia.
Another objective is to visualize the district prices on a map by giving each district a color depending on houses rent prices in that district.
Also, we tried to extract more useful information from the dataset (extracted from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lama122/saudi-arabia-real-estate-aqar).
To avoid Python libraries compatibility problems please use the same Python version used in this project which is 3.10.
More information extracted from the dataset can be found in Dataset&INFO folder.
Please note that some preprocessing/cleaning steps were done manually in another Jupiter notebook draft which is not included in the project files.
